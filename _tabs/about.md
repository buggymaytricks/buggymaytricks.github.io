# About buGGy

Hey, I'm buGGy — a cybersecurity enthusiast driven by an obsession with figuring out how things break and why they do.

My focus areas are web application security, network enumeration, OSINT, and red team tactics — the gritty, hands-on side of cybersecurity. I've done a couple of focused internships that gave me a taste of the real world, but most of my growth has come from experimenting, self-learning, and pushing limits on my own terms. From playing CTFs to poking around in bug bounty platforms, I've built a mindset that's less about checklists and more about curiosity, edge cases, and creativity.

I'm not tied to any fixed method or routine — I dive into whatever catches my eye, whether it's a vulnerable API buried deep in a web app or an obscure enumeration path that others might overlook. Sometimes it's exploring an idea that sounds too chaotic to be real — and that's what makes it worth doing.

This site is a reflection of that process — a mix of deep dives, notes from the field, random obsessions, and battle scars from nights spent figuring things out the hard way. No fluff, no titles, just signal.
