## Who I Am

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with **2+ years** of dedicated learning in offensive & defensive security, complemented by **2 internships** focused on training and hands-on projects. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering while actively honing my skills through labs, CTFs, and security research.

My core focus areas include **network penetration testing**, **Active Directory attacks**, and **SOC operations/threat detection**. I approach security from both attacker and defender perspectives — understanding how systems break and how to detect & respond to threats.
