## Who I Am

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with **2+ years** of hands-on experience in offensive security. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering while actively honing my skills through labs, CTFs, and real-world security research.

My core focus areas include **web application penetration testing**, **Active Directory attacks**, and **privilege escalation**. I approach security with an attacker's mindset — understanding how systems break to help build better defenses.
