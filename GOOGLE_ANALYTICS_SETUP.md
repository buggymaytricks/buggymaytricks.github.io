# Google Analytics Implementation Summary

## What Was Done
Google Analytics tracking has been successfully added to every page of your Jekyll website using tracking ID: **G-JPKCLHBXFJ**

## Files Modified:

### 1. `_config.yml`
- Added Google Analytics ID to the analytics configuration section
- This enables Google Analytics for all Jekyll theme pages (blog posts, categories, tags, etc.)

### 2. `index.html` (Main Landing Page)
- Added Google Analytics tracking code directly to the `<head>` section
- Updated Content Security Policy to allow Google Analytics domains
- Added necessary domains: `www.googletagmanager.com`, `www.google-analytics.com`, `analytics.google.com`

### 3. `_includes/head-custom.html` (Created)
- Created a custom include file that ensures Google Analytics is loaded on all theme pages
- Uses Jekyll's built-in analytics configuration

### 4. `_includes/google-analytics.html` (Created)
- Standalone Google Analytics include file for reference

## Pages Covered:
✅ **Main landing page** (`index.html`)
✅ **Blog pages** (using `default` and `post` layouts)
✅ **Category pages**
✅ **Tag pages** 
✅ **Archive pages**
✅ **About page**
✅ **All other Jekyll theme pages**

## How It Works:
1. **Jekyll Theme Pages**: The Chirpy theme automatically includes Google Analytics when the ID is set in `_config.yml`
2. **Custom Pages**: The main `index.html` has the tracking code manually added
3. **All pages** now include the Google Analytics tracking script

## Verification:
The site has been built successfully and the tracking code appears in all generated HTML files.

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy the site to see Google Analytics in action
2. Check your Google Analytics dashboard for incoming traffic data
3. It may take a few hours for data to appear in your analytics dashboard

## Notes:
- The tracking will work in both development and production environments
- Content Security Policy has been updated to allow Google Analytics scripts
- All modern browsers will properly load and execute the tracking code
