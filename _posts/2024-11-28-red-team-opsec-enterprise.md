# Red Team OPSEC: Staying Ghost in Enterprise Networks

Operational Security (OPSEC) is the cornerstone of successful red team operations. In this post, I'll share advanced techniques and principles for maintaining persistence in enterprise networks while avoiding detection by modern security controls.

## The OPSEC Mindset

Red team operations require a fundamentally different approach than traditional penetration testing. While pentests focus on finding vulnerabilities, red team exercises simulate real adversaries who prioritize stealth and persistence over speed.

## Key Principles

### 1. Minimize Your Footprint
- Use legitimate tools whenever possible
- Avoid dropping files to disk
- Leverage living-off-the-land techniques
- Memory-only payloads and execution

### 2. Blend with Normal Traffic
- Mimic legitimate user behavior
- Use standard ports and protocols
- Implement jitter and randomization
- Respect business hours and patterns

### 3. Operational Tradecraft
- Compartmentalize access and knowledge
- Implement proper communication security
- Use operational security throughout the engagement
- Plan for detection and incident response

## Conclusion

Effective OPSEC is what separates script kiddies from professional red team operators. By following these principles and continuously adapting to the evolving threat landscape, red teams can provide valuable insights to organizations while maintaining operational security.
