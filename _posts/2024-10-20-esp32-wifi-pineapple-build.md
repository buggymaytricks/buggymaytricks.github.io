# ESP32 WiFi Pineapple: Building Custom Hardware for Security Testing

The WiFi Pineapple has long been a staple tool for wireless security assessments, but what if you could build your own custom device with enhanced capabilities? In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create a powerful wireless security testing platform using the versatile ESP32 microcontroller.

## Why ESP32?

The ESP32 offers several advantages for security testing:
- Dual-core processor with WiFi and Bluetooth
- Low power consumption
- Extensive GPIO capabilities
- Large community and library support
- Cost-effective (under $10)

## Project Overview

Our custom ESP32 WiFi security tool will include:
- Deauthentication attacks
- WPA handshake capture
- WPS vulnerability testing
- Packet analysis and injection
- Custom web interface for control

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- microSD card module
- OLED display (optional)
- External antenna (for better range)
- 3D printed or custom enclosure

## Software Architecture
